		<p>The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia clan in New York City, led by aging patriarch Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). The film opens with a wedding, where Don Corleone offers favors and settles disputes to maintain his influence. His youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), initially wants nothing to do with the family business. However, when a rival gang targets the Corleones, Michael is drawn into the world of violence and revenge. He proves himself to be a ruthless and cunning strategist, shocking everyone, including himself. As the family war escalates, Michael eliminates threats and takes over the operation, transforming from reluctant outsider to ruthless Mafia boss.</p>
